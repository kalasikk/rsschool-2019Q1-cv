            <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
                My goal is, of course, to gain experience, because I understand perfectly well that any 
                experience that I could get is very important to me. In these courses, I am sure there will be 
                a large number of tasks that I will not even imagine at first glance how to implement, but rest assured,
                I will sit and understand until I complete it completely. Each task is something new for me,
                and I am open to this new one. What really hooks you up will be my complete immersion in a topic that
                I enjoy. I will give all of myself and all my creativity to complete the task. For me, it is important 
                how the product looks, so I usually try to make it so nice to look at the result . It is very easy to 
                work with me, because usually I find a common language with any person, I can often put myself in his place,
                which is why I am non-contentious. I am also very responsible,
                therefore I approach to the fulfillment of tasks very seriously and with concentration.
