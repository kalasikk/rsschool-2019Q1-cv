3.  #### Summary 
     *My goal is, of course, to gain experience, because I understand perfectly well that any experience that I could get is very important to me. In these courses, I am sure there will be a large number of tasks that I will not even imagine at first glance how to implement, but rest assured, I will sit and understand until I complete it completely. Each task is something new for me, and I am open to this new one. What really hooks you up will be my complete immersion in a topic that I enjoy. I will give all of myself and all my creativity to complete the task. For me, it is important how the product looks, so I usually try to make it so nice to look at the result . It is very easy to work with me, because usually I find a common language with any person, I can often put myself in his place, which is why I am non-contentious. I am also very responsible, therefore I approach to the fulfillment of tasks very seriously and with concentration.*
